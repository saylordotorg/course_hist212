This course will introduce you to United States history from the end of
the Civil War in 1865 through the first decade of the twenty-first
century. You will learn about the major political, economic, and social
changes that took place in America during this nearly 150-year period.
The course will be structured chronologically, with each unit focusing
on a significant historical subject. The units will include
representative primary-source documents that illustrate important
overarching political, economic, and social themes, such as the growth
and expansion of political representation and civil rights in America,
industrial development and economic change, race and ethnicity in
American society, and cultural change over time. These primary documents
offer you insights into the thinking of people who directly witnessed
and experienced these historical developments. By the end of the course,
you will understand how the United States grew from a relatively weak
and divided agricultural nation into a cohesive military and industrial
superpower by the beginning of the twenty-first century.
