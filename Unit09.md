**Unit 9: The Vietnam Era** <span id="9"></span> 
**During the 1950s and 1960s, many American officials firmly believed in
the Domino Theory, which held that a Communist revolution in one nation
would eventually lead to Communist revolutions in surrounding countries,
meaning that an entire region would fall to the Soviet Union like a row
of dominos. Guided by this theory, the U.S. government sent troops to
South Vietnam, a small Southeast Asian nation involved in a guerrilla
war with North Vietnam, its Communist neighbor. Direct U.S. military
involvement in Vietnam began when President Dwight Eisenhower sent small
numbers of military advisors to aid the South Vietnamese military in the
1950s. By the mid-1960s, President Lyndon Johnson made the decision to
escalate America’s involvement in this conflict and sent a large number
of U.S. combat troops to the area. Between 1965 and 1973, American
troops engaged in a bloody jungle war against Viet Cong guerillas and
North Vietnamese Army troops across much of South Vietnam as well as in
the neighboring countries of Laos and Cambodia.*  
    
 *We will now examine how the U.S. became involved in the Vietnam War
and why the country finally chose to withdraw troops in 1972. We will
also look at the impact of the war on American society and examine the
activities of the vocal Anti-War Movement that developed in the United
States during the conflict. Our study of the Vietnam Era will show that
the war had a profound and lasting effect on the United States. **
