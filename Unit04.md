**Unit 4: Political and Social Reform Movements** <span id="4"></span> 
*The 1890s and early 1900s witnessed a profound social and political
reaction to the Gilded Age, the period between the early 1870s and late
1890s, characterized by its excesses and corruption. In the Midwest,
farmers and workers organized political movements to reign in the power
of corrupt corporations that dominated local economies and controlled
access to credit and transportation resources. Populists demanded
greater political democracy and increased access to economic resources
for poor and middle-class Americans. In American cities, middle-class
reformers organized political movements to address crime, pollution,
urban decay, and other unintended consequences of industrialization. The
Progressives also tried to “Americanize” immigrants and promote
responsible, middle-class lifestyles by organizing settlement houses for
immigrants and campaigning against alcohol consumption. We will examine
how both of these political and social movements reformed the structure
of American democracy and altered the character and appearance of
American cities at the turn of the twentieth century. *

    focuses on the emergence of two major political and social reform
    movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

    inspiration. Progressives attempted to use the power of government
    to improve America’s cities and institute major economic reforms at
    the national level.

    Democratic convention in 1896, please consider the following
    questions: In this speech, for what groups in society did William
    Jennings Bryan claim to be their spokesman? Besides his support for
    coining silver, what in this speech would have been appealing to
    Populists? Bryan and his supporters argued that the federal
    government should purchase and coin silver in addition to gold. Both
    measures were favored by Populists, because they would create jobs
    in the western mining industry and increase the money supply in the
    United States, which would make it easier for farmers to pay down
    their debts.
