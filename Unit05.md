**Unit 5: World War I and the 1920s** <span id="5"></span> 
**When the nations of Europe declared war on each other in the summer of
1914, few observers expected the conflict to last more than a few
months. President Woodrow Wilson declared American neutrality and
attempted to keep the nation isolated from the violent conflict. As the
war gradually expanded throughout much of the world, both sides suffered
millions of casualties. Wilson continued to champion American neutrality
and won reelection in 1916 on an anti-war platform, but less than a year
later, German attacks on American shipping convinced him to declare war
on the Central Powers. Fresh American soldiers joined weary English and
French troops along the Western Front and eventually forced Germany to
declare an armistice on November 11, 1918. In this unit, we will discuss
how the war affected the United States and examine why Woodrow Wilson’s
plans for a League of Nations failed to receive Congressional approval.
In the decade following this war, many Americans feared foreign
influences that could, in their view, undermine the American way of
life, and this period witnessed a “Red Scare,” a resurgence of nativism
and race riots. We will also examine how Americans lived, worked, and
played during this decade of economic and technological abundance.**

     Instructions: Watch this lecture, in which Professor Merriman
    discusses the events leading to World War I. Many experts believed
    the war would be short and decisive, but British, French, and German
    armies on the Western Front quickly bogged down and began
    constructing massive trench lines along the entire front. Each side
    fought a bloody war of attrition for the next three years as the
    armies tried to wear out the industrial and military capacities of
    the opposing side.

     Instructions: Read the primary-source document on the webpage.  
        
     Note on the Text: In his “War Message,” President Woodrow Wilson
    presents specific arguments as to why the United States can no
    longer remain neutral. He argues that Germany and its allies have
    violated American neutrality and the United States must respond
    militarily in order to make the world “safe for democracy.” After
    reading this document, consider the following questions: What recent
    historical events did Wilson touch on as grounds for war with
    Germany? Why would a war against Germany be a war to advance
    democracy? How did Wilson characterize the government of Germany at
    this time? What actions, according to Wilson, did the United States
    need to implement to prosecute this war?

     Instructions: Watch these lectures. The classic American novel, The
    Great Gatsby (1925) by F. Scott Fitzgerald was set in America in the
    1920s. In these lectures Warnes discusses the historical context of
    this novel, focusing on mass consumption and materialism of this
    era. Consumption of retail goods, such as ready-to-wear clothing,
    automobiles, and other products, increasingly came to define the
    “American way of life.” For the first time, many Americans purchased
    consumer products on credit rather than saving for them. By the end
    of the decade, consumer spending made up a significant portion of
    the American economy.

    culture to mainstream America. The mass exodus of African-Americans
    from the South to the industrial North beginning in the 1910s and
    lasting through the 1920s changed the demographics of America’s
