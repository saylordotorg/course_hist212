**Unit 2: American Industrialization** <span id="2"></span> 
**The Civil War devastated the southern economy, but it encouraged the
rapid growth and expansion of new industries such as steel and textile
manufacturing in the North. In the decades immediately following this
war, growing numbers of immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe
provided much of the manpower for these new factories. Meanwhile,
native-born Americans tended to find well-paid jobs as supervisors and
managers. This economic disparity resulted in workplace violence and led
to unionization efforts in many industries. In this unit, you will
explore the ways in which industrialization changed the character of
many American cities and had a profound impact on economic, political,
and social life during this “Gilded Age” (c. 1876-1900). **

     Instructions: Watch all three sections, and read the accompanying
    text for each.  
        
     This presentation focuses on America’s rapid industrial expansion
    following the Civil War. Many factors contributed to this second
    Industrial Revolution, including abundant natural resources, labor
    supplies, and financial capitol. Numerous entrepreneurs were
    responsible for creating large corporations in fields such as steel
    manufacturing, banking, and railroad transportation by uniting
    smaller companies to take advantage of economies of scale and
    greater managerial efficiencies. Some corporations amassed so much
    economic and political power during this era that the federal
    government was forced to step in and regulate their business
    practices in order to keep them from taking over entire
    industries.

    expansion of large corporations in the closing decades of the
    nineteenth century. During this era, America quickly evolved from a
    nation of small, localized businesses to a nation of powerful
    corporations whose operations spanned the entire country.

    Instructions: Read this entry on Frederick W. Taylor, the father of
    the field known as Scientific Management. Taylor believed that
    factory production was inefficient because workers were inefficient.
    He developed techniques for simplifying industrial production by
    conducting studies of workers’ actions and then implementing new
    work practices to eliminate wasteful motions and actions. Why did
    Taylor’s techniques prove to be very controversial in the workplace?

    performance-based monetary compensation. Taylor’s ideas
    revolutionized workplace management in American factories and
    initiated the Scientific Management movement throughout the world.

     Note on the Media: This presentation focuses on immigration in the
    post-Civil War era. In the closing decades of the
    nineteenth century, millions of non-Western European immigrants
    began arriving in the United States. Some people immigrated in order
    to escape conflict and discrimination in their homelands. Others
    sought new work opportunities. The massive wave of immigration from
    Eastern Europe and Asia changed the face of many American cities
    during this period and led to political and social conflicts between
    immigrants and native-born Americans. Eventually, in the late 1910s,
    Congress acted to curb immigration by setting quotas on the numbers
    of immigrants that would be accepted from other countries around the
    globe.

    around the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. This book concerns the
    experiences and the living and working conditions in New York City
    for new immigrants. After reading excerpts from this book, consider
    the following questions: How would you describe the nature of the
    work for Italian immigrant workers? Were these women victimized and
    exploited, or were they scrappy women who took advantage of any
    opportunity to improve their lives? Do their stories put immigration
    in this era in a positive or negative light?

     Instructions: Read Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.   
        
     Note on the Text: In *How the Other Half Lives*, journalist Jacob
    A. Riis describes immigrant life in New York City at the end of the
    nineteenth century. In Chapters 3 and 4, Riis paints a vivid picture
    of urban decay and corruption and describes the squalor of immigrant
    living conditions in the tenements and back allies of lower
    Manhattan.   
      
     After reading Riis’s description of urban life in New York City in
    1890, consider the following questions: What immigrant groups did
    Riis identify as inhabitants of the city? What were the particular
    hazards of living in the tenements, according to Riis? How does
    Riis’s description of urban life compare with Sadie’s account of her
    experiences in this same city at the turn of the twentieth
    century?

     Note on the Media: This presentation focuses on the lives of
    industrial workers during the late nineteenth century and discusses
    efforts by workers to form unions. Many employers challenged
    employee unionization efforts and used coercive measures to break
    unions, or keep them from forming in their shops. Labor unions
    gradually achieved limited victories during the Gilded Age, such as
    federal 8-hour workday legislation, but also suffered serious
    defeats by powerful industrial employers.

     Instructions: Read the article from the beginning up until the
    subunit titled “Immigration and Urbanization.” Note that this
    article focuses on the history of workers in the Western world, the
    lives of industrial workers (including women and children) in late
    nineteenth century America, and the major strikes and labor protests
    of the era. Workers took great risks when they challenged the power
    of industrialists by going on strike, and few strikes were
    successful during this era. Commonly, city, state, and national
    leaders used private militias, police, and military forces to
    intimidate and threaten striking workers. Company owners also used
    strikebreakers to run factories and mines in place of striking
    workers. Nevertheless, the handful of successful strikes during this
    era demonstrated that workers possessed the power to shape their own
    destiny in the workplace. This reading covers topics in subunits
    2.3.1-2.3.3.

     Note on the Media: This presentation focuses on the growth and
    maturation of America’s cities in the late nineteenth century.
    Industrialization, immigration, and economic opportunities each
    played an important role in the rapid growth of cities. Architects
    began building up, as well as out, in order to accommodate business
    interests and the first skyscrapers appeared during this era. The
    city was also a place of pollution and disease. Urban slums were a
    dominant feature of all cities. Many middle and upper class
    residents fled urban cores for healthier and cleaner “streetcar
    suburbs.” Nevertheless, city life dominated American life and the
    country entered the twentieth century as an industrial, urbanized
    nation.   
      
     Reading the text and watching the video should take approximately 1

    this new style of building. Also in discussing the poverty of New

    for addressing this problem and offers his own solutions, which
    reflect the anti-immigrant views of some Americans at this time.
