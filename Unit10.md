**Unit 10: The Conservative Ascendancy - The "Reagan Revolution"** <span
id="10"></span> 
*America’s defeat in the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon’s resignation due
to the Watergate Scandal plunged the nation into a period of popular
discontent with political institution and leaders. Gerald Ford, Nixon’s
Republican successor, did little to alleviate this discontent and voters
elected Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter to replace him in 1976. Carter
won voters with his folksy personality and his “outside the Beltway”
credentials, but his popularity faded as an oil crisis, economic
stagnation, and rampant inflation plunged the nation into an economic
recession. *  
    
 *In 1980, frustrated voters elected Ronald Reagan, the former Governor
of California, president. Reagan’s optimism and his
moderate-conservative political views appealed to many Americans. Reagan
also promoted an aggressive foreign agenda and called for renewed U.S.
military strength in the ongoing Cold War with the Soviets. Under
Reagan’s administration, the U.S. economy improved and his firm stance
with the Soviet Union led to unexpected diplomatic opportunities. *  
    
 **In this unit, we will evaluate the Carter and Reagan years and
examine Reagan’s economic and political legacy. We will also look at the
role his policies may have played in the bringing about the downfall of
the Soviet Union in 1991.    **

     Note on the Media: In one of the most memorable speeches of his two
