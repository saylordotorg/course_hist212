**Unit 3: Expanding Frontiers** <span id="3"></span> 
*American explorers and settlers had pushed steadily westward across the
North American continent since the earliest days of the Republic. In the
process, they displaced many Native-American inhabitants, often through
coercion and violence. After the end of the Civil War, the U.S.
Government took an active role in promoting settlement of the
Trans-Mississippi West and suppressing Native-American resistance
through military force. In this unit, we will take a look at how
Americans settled the West and examine their encounters with
Native-American inhabitants across the western frontier. *  
    
 *We will then learn that, at the end of the nineteenth century, many
Americans turned their attention from the western frontier to the
international frontier. A short and successful war with Spain in 1898
led to the U.S. occupation of Cuba and the Philippine Islands. The U.S.
also began to flex its military might elsewhere in Latin America and
across the Pacific Ocean. We will examine how America emerged as a world
power by the early twentieth century and explore the parallels between
western settlement and international expansion. *

     Instructions: Read chapter 1 of Turner’s “The Frontier in American
    History”.   
        
     Note on the Text: Historian Frederick Jackson Turner originally
    presented the essay that appears in Chapter 1 of his book to a
    meeting of fellow historians in the summer of 1893. In this essay,
    he argues that the frontier (as both a real location and a concept)
    played a critical role in shaping American identity in the
    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern historians have
    challenged elements of Turner’s “Frontier Thesis,” but his views
    demonstrate how important the frontier was for many Americans in the
    late nineteenth century. After reading this document consider the
    following questions: According to Turner, how did westward expansion
    influence American history? How did this movement shape American
    political institutions? How did this movement help mold Americans’
    national character?
