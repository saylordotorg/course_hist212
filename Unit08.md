**Unit 8: The Civil Rights Movement** <span id="8"></span> 
**Reconstruction offered African-Americans a chance to participate in
the American political process and exercise their civil rights, but this
opportunity was short-lived in many southern states. Once Reconstruction
ended in 1877, African-Americans faced harassment, violence, and
intimidation at the polling booth. Jim Crow laws segregated
African-Americans from white society and denied them equal rights and
protections. Lynch mobs killed blacks that challenged white rule.
African-American leaders in the North organized political campaigns to
challenge segregation and discrimination and expose lynch-mob justice.
By the end of the Second World War, this burgeoning civil rights
movement began to have an impact on American society. In 1954, the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the “separate but equal” doctrine from the 1896
Plessy v. Ferguson decision in the landmark Brown v. Board decision.
This decision spurred civil rights organizers to push for voter rights
legislation and challenge racist southern political leaders who refused
to integrate public facilities. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will look at the historical origins of the 1960s
Civil Rights Movement and examine the legacies of various civil rights
leaders, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. We will also look at the
broader social and cultural consequences of the Civil Rights Movements,
including the emergence of the modern Feminist Movement, Gay and Lesbian
Rights Movements, and the Ethnic Rights Movements of the 1960s and
1970s.  **

     Note on the Text: In the *Brown v. Board of Education *majority
    opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren states that the doctrine of
    “separate but equal” in public education is unconstitutional,
    because it denies Americans equal protection under the law. The
    ruling would play a major role in providing a legal basis for civil
    rights political campaigns of the 1960s. After reading this
    document, consider the following questions: According to Chief
    Justice Earl Warren, why did segregated schools violate the
    Fourteenth amendment? How does this decision compare and contrast
    with the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision (see section
    1.3.3)?
