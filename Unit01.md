**Unit 1: Reconstruction** <span id="1"></span> 
**Even before the last shots of the Civil War had been fired, President
Lincoln and members of Congress faced serious questions about how to
rebuild and reunite the war-torn United States and provide for nearly
four million former slaves. The way in which the government responded to
these questions shaped and defined the period now known as
Reconstruction, the 12-year period following the Civil War from 1865 to
1877.**  
  
 **Reconstruction was a time of significant political and social change
in the United States. In this unit, we will take a look at the
controversial origins of Reconstruction and evaluate its successes and
failures. We will also examine how former slaves struggled against
prejudice and political repression in the American South as they
attempted to build new lives for themselves and their families. Finally,
we will ask why Reconstruction came to an abrupt end in 1877 and
evaluate its political and social legacy in the United States.**

     This presentation discusses President Abraham Lincoln’s and
    President Andrew Johnson’s plans for Reconstruction following the
    Civil War. Both men offered generous terms of reconciliation to the
    defeated southern states and hoped to reintegrate these state back

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: In this 1866 proclamation, President Andrew Johnson
    notes all the official statements made by the U.S. government during
    the Civil War about the South being in a state of rebellion against
    the Union. He then concludes that civil order and police authority
    have been restored to the South, and it is no longer officially in a
    state of insurrection. Johnson’s proclamation opened the door for
    these states to rejoin the Union politically, economically, and
    socially. After reading this document, consider the following
    questions: What does this document tell us about President Johnson’s
    opinion of the Confederate States of America and the concept of
    secession? What does this document reveal concerning Johnson’s
    position on the rights of Americans under the U.S. Constitution? How
    might the views expressed by Johnson here help explain his later
    opposition to Congressional Reconstruction (see subunit 1.1.2
    below).

     This presentation discusses the role that Congress played in
    Reconstruction. Congressional Republications objected to President
    Andrew Johnson’s weak Reconstruction policies that allowed former
    Confederates to re-enter political office and did little to protect
    the civil rights of newly freed African-Americans. They passed
    important Constitutional amendments guaranteeing blacks voting
    rights and U.S. citizenship. Congress also ordered the U.S. Army to
    establish military districts in the South in order to enforce these
    new laws. Southern states could regain home rule only after they
    agreed to ratify the new civil rights legislation.

     Instructions: In this June 20, 1866 report, Northern Republicans in
    Congress challenged President Andrew Johnson’s plans to allow
    Southern states to once again elect senators and representatives.
    The congressmen argued that the Southern states voluntarily withdrew
    from the Union and consequently lost their right to elect members to
    Congress. They asserted that Southern states should only be allowed
    to return members to Congress once they have reorganized their state
    governments and addressed civil rights concerns. After reading this
    document, consider the following questions: What reasons were given
    in this congressional report for suspending the rights of some of
    the inhabitants of the former Confederacy? According to this report,
    why was it necessary to guarantee the rights of the African American
    freedmen? How would the proposals made in this report enable the
    Republican Party to dominate in the states of the former
    Confederacy?

    Andrew Johnson. Radical Republicans in Congress objected to
    Johnson’s sympathetic attitude toward the South and passed the
    Military Reconstruction Act and civil rights legislation over his
    veto. When Johnson challenged Congress’s power to oversee
    Reconstruction efforts, the House of Representatives drew up
    impeachment charges against him and put him on trial. Johnson was
    not impeached, but he did leave office once his term expired.

     Instructions: Read this document.  
        
     In this 1867 appeal to Congress, prominent African American
    advocate, Frederick Douglass discusses the importance of voting
    rights. He warns the members of Congress that Southern White
    Democrats will unite with Northern Democrats to regain control of
    the federal government if the Republicans in Congress do not enforce
    voting rights for African Americans. If the Democrats secure control
    of Congress, they will stop enforcing civil rights laws and take
    away African Americans hard-won freedoms. After reading this
    document, consider the following questions: In his appeal, what
    arguments does Frederick Douglass employ to persuade Congress to
    grant African Americans the right to vote? According to Douglass,
    what would be the negative consequences of denying African Americans
    the right to vote? To what extent were Douglass’s warnings prophetic
    (see subunit 1.3.3)?

    topics for sections 1.3.1-1.3.3.  
        
     This presentation focuses on the political and economic turmoil in
    the United States during 1870s. Economic panic and political
    corruption in the federal government distracted many Americans in
    the North from the ongoing social and legal problems that African
    Americans faced in the South. The disputed election of 1876 enabled
    Democrats to make a compromise with Republicans that ended
    Reconstruction in exchange for Republican Rutherford B. Hayes
    gaining the presidency. The end of Reconstruction allowed southern
    states to restore unjust racial codes that openly discriminated
    against African Americans.

     Instructions: In this 1896 ruling, Justice Brown of the US Supreme
    Court presents the majority opinion of the court, which affirms a
    Louisiana state court’s ruling that racial segregation in railroad
    cars does not violate the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of
    the Constitution. The *Plessy v. Ferguson *case provided the legal
    basis for segregation of all public facilities in most southern

    consider the following questions: How does this Supreme Court
    decision distinguish between political and social equality? How did
    this distinction shape this Supreme Court decision? In this
