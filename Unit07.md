**Unit 7: The Cold War** <span id="7"></span> 
**The economic destruction and loss of life caused by World War II
devastated Great Britain, Germany, France, and much of Eastern Europe
and Asia. Only the democratic United States and the totalitarian Soviet
Union emerged from the war as strong international superpowers. Mutual
distrust, fear, and hostility in both nations led to decades of
military, economic, and political conflict throughout the globe. Both
nations possessed powerful military arsenals and could not take one
another on directly without fear of mutual destruction. Instead, they
engaged in indirect conflicts as the Soviet Union tried to support
Communist revolutionaries in many developing nations and the U.S. tried
to keep anti-communist forces in control of these countries. *  
  
 *At home, some Americans grew worried that Soviet spies and secret
Communists were infiltrating American society and attempted to persecute
suspected Communists for disloyalty and treason. This unit will examine
the military and political dimensions of the Cold War and the Second Red
Scare and take a look at the cultural trends, demographic changes, and
economic prosperity in the United States during the 1950s.  *
