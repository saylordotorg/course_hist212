**Unit 6: The Great Depression and World War II** <span id="6"></span> 
**A stock market crash that began in September of 1929 and continued
through November signaled the end of the Roaring Twenties. Falling stock
prices throughout the world triggered an economic panic that rippled
throughout the entire U.S. economy. While only a small percentage of
Americans owned stocks, commercial banks with large stock investments
failed and soon pulled down other financial institutions, as investors
rushed to withdraw their money from failing banks, which in turn led to
further bank failures. Unemployment rates rose as worldwide consumption
of manufactured goods fell and many companies laid off workers or went
out of business. This stock market crash was the final devastating blow
to an economy already weakened by stagnating business profits and wages.
President Herbert Hoover tried to reassure the nation but refused to
take drastic measures to prop up the U.S. economy and end the Great
Depression. Hoover lost the 1932 presidential election to Democrat
Franklin Roosevelt who promised through his “New Deal” to use every
means available to put Americans back to work and end the Great
Depression.   
*  
 *In this unit, we will examine the policies and people behind
Roosevelt’s New Deal, and analyze the impact that the New Deal had on
the American economy and American society. We will also look at the
emergence of totalitarian governments in Germany, Italy, and Japan
during the Depression, and examine the origins of the Second World War.
During the conflict, the U.S. engaged in a two-front war across the
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and with the development of the atomic
bomb, the U.S. emerged from the conflict as the most powerful nation on
the planet.**

    President Herbert Hoover’s unsuccessful efforts to deal with the
    Great Depression in the early 1930s. Hoover was a trained engineer
    with years of government experience, but he was not willing at first
    to use the power of the federal government to tackle the growing
    unemployment rate or prop up failing banks. Instead, he was more
    concerned with balancing the federal budget through income tax and
    tariff increases. Only in the final year of his term in office did
    he begin creating government programs to tackle the Depression, but
    by that point Americans had lost their faith in Hoover’s
    abilities.
