**Unit 11: New World Disorder** <span id="11"></span> 
**Our final unit will evaluate trends in U.S. history during the 1990s
and early 2000s. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States no longer had a powerful international adversary. Instead,
America provided support for the reconstruction and reunification of
Germany and much of Eastern Europe. With NATO and European Union allies,
U.S. forces assisted with military and humanitarian efforts in the
former Yugoslavian republics and Somalia. At home, economic prosperity
pushed the stock market to new levels and some Americans began to speak
of permanent economic prosperity. At the same time, warning signs of a
growing threat from Islamist extremists began to appear abroad. Embassy
bombings and attacks on U.S. forces in the late 1990s preceded the 9-11
terrorist attacks in which Al Qaeda targeted New York City and
Washington, DC. These attacks resulted in the U.S. engaging in long
military struggles in Afghanistan (beginning in 2001) and Iraq
(beginning in 2003). By late 2008, the economic bubble that had been
growing since early 2002 finally burst, plunging the U.S. stock market
into the worst circumstances since the Great Depression and initiating a
steep economic decline. In response to these problems, voters elected
Barack Obama president based on his message of change and renewal. We
will examine these contemporary political, economic, and social trends
within the context of the past century of American history. **

     Note on the Media: Section one discusses the presidency of George
    H.W. Bush. Bush entered office promising to continue the economic
    policies of Ronald Reagan. In office he faced numerous international
    challenges, including the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Bush organized
    a coalition of nations to fight the Persian Gulf War and liberate
    Kuwait. His domestic policies, though, could not prevent a declining
    economy, which led to his decline in popularity among voters.

     Note on the Media: Section 2 discusses the presidency of Bill
    Clinton. Clinton ran as a moderate Democrat in 1992 and gained
    widespread support from Americans frustrated by George H.W. Bush’s
    policies. In office, Clinton attempted a number of ambitious
    legislative proposals including a universal healthcare plan. Popular
    dissatisfaction with his ideas led to a Republican takeover of
    Congress in 1994. During his remaining time in office, Clinton was
    forced to work with Republicans in order to pass necessary
    legislation. Clinton’s personal actions while in office also led to
    an impeachment effort by Congress, which failed to gain the
    necessary votes for approval.
